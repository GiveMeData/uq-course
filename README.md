# Introduction to Uncertainty Quantification

The goal of this course is to introduce the fundamentals of uncertainty quantification to advanced undergraduates or graduate engineering and science students with research interests in the field of predictive modeling. Upon completion of this course the students should be able to:

+ Represent mathematically the uncertainty in the parameters of physical models.
+ Propagate parametric uncertainty through physical models to quantify the induced uncertainty on quantities of interest.
+ Calibrate the parameters of physical models using experimental data.
+ Combine multiple sources of information to enhance the predictive capabilities of models.
+ Pose and solve design optimization problems under uncertainty involving expensive computer simulations.
